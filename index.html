      <h2>Beres Hammond for the Ladies</h2>
      <div>
      <p  class="pat">Beres Hammond OJ (born Hugh Beresford Hammond; 28 August 1955, in Annotto Bay, Saint Mary, Jamaica) is a Jamaican
          reggae singer known in particular for his lovers rock music. While his career began in the 1970s, he reached his greatest success in the 1990s.Beres is know for his cool soft approached
          in his delivery, but don't be deceived by that cool profile.The playful smile, the unassuming demeanor, the beard and the cap and the spectacles might lull you into forgetting that you’re in the presence of an awesome musical talent, Jamaica’s greatest practicing singer/songwriter. Beres remains cool, though he knows that he’s one of a handful of people responsible formaintaining a mighty legacy of soulful reggae music—a select group of artists like Toots and Gregory, like Dennis and Bob. “Father bless me with a song,” he pleads on the last cut of his latest album, Music Is Life, “to make the whole world sing along. Regardless of the race, regardless of the taste.” In the year 2021, the blessings just keep coming, and the world is just starting to catch on. </p>
          
          <p class="pat1">Over the course of five decade career, Beres has poured his smoky-sweet voice—an instrument of subtlety and power reminiscent of an Otis Redding or a Teddy Pendergrass—over every kind of riddim track, from the funked-up reggae jams of the ’70s fusion band Zap Pow to the lush instrumentation of his 1976 album Soul Reggae to the spare digital beat of his 1985 dancehall breakthrough “What One Dance Can Do.” 
           Some of Beres signature hits in my opinion are cuts like “Tempted To Touch” and “Who Say” with Buju Banton "Putting Up Resistance" , "Come Back Home","Double Trouble" are still as effective in the dancehall today.
          Beres is known as a show stopper. His music brings joy to women as his lyrics are always about his affection to them. He is known for his live concerts where he will fill stadiums of screaming fans in the Caribbean, South America,Europe and North America. </p>

          <p class="pat1">Beres’s sophisticated musical taste is well suited to translate easily across cultural divides, yet the international reggae massive has remained his most loyal fan base. He did collaborate on Maxi Priest’s first 
           American hit, “How Can We Ease The Pain,” in 1990. A brief encounter with Elektra Records in 1994 yielded the 
           excellent but under-appreciated album In Control with its R&B-flavored single “No Disturb Sign.”Beres was a little reluctant to change as he once said,“I personally don’t believe in a whole heap of technology business,“It’s all about what you have to offer. As long as your vibes is there, that’s what the people feel.”
          However, the Covid 19 pandemic has brought change to everyone. Being the boss he is and the love for his fans, he held a virtual concert on social media that drew thousands of fans around the world. It was a blast.
